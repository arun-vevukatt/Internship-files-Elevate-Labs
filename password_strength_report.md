## Passwords Tested

| Password | Length | Complexity | Score (out of 100) | Estimated Crack Time | Tool Feedback |
|----------|--------|------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| `password123` | 11 | Lowercase, Numbers | 25 | Instant | Too common, predictable |
| `P@ssw0rd!` | 9 | Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols | 75 | Few hours | Better, still predictable |
| `G&k9@Zp2#FvL` | 12 | High complexity | 95 | Centuries | Very strong |
| `AtuF_2025!*` | 11 | Uppercase, lowercase, symbols, numbers | 90 | Centuries | Excellent |
| `!C0mpl3xPass#123!` | 16 | Very High | 100 | Millions of years | Extremely strong |

## Common Password Attack Methods

- **Brute Force Attack:** Tries all combinations until it succeeds.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses a list of common words and variations.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Tries known leaked passwords on other sites.

## Summary

Password strength depends on length, complexity, and unpredictability. Tools like PasswordMeter and NordPass can estimate how secure a password is and how long it would take to crack. Strong passwords can resist brute-force attacks and make it significantly harder for attackers to gain access.
